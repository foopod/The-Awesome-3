    <p style="padding:1em;">Hi, my name is Amelia Lockley. I am eleven years old and 
         coding is one of my passions. I go to a code club at Orion Health once a week and have been going for over a year now. I have learnt to code using scratch, html & css and python. After I finish working on this website I will go onto to my next project for next year's BrightSparks competition and I will also go onto construct 2. <br><br>When I grow up I want to be a Mechatronic engineer and work somewhere like JPL at NASA where one of my idols, Michelle Easter, works. Another of my role models is Dr Michelle Dickinson AKA Nanogirl. I have been to many coding/tech events, for example OMGTECH. I also attended the BrightSparks finals last year with Ruth, who runs the Orion Health Code Club. I first met Dr Michelle Dickinson at OMGTECH in Auckland, my Dad has also met Nano Girl at TechEd NZ and she has also spoken at my school.  <br><br>I attend Diocesan school for girls and have been there since year one, I am now in year seven. My favourite subjects at school are science and math. I am taking Japanese and Chinese as languages at school. I am interested in math, science, robotics and music. I play piano, cello and also sing in two choirs. My Mum is from Indonesia, and my Dad is from England and I am an only child. My favourite foods are chicken and pesto rice and katsu chicken, and my least favourite food is spinach. My favourite colours are turquoise and peach, my favourite animal is a Dolphin. </p>

    <p style="padding:1em;">Hi, I'm Ellen Healey. I am 12 years old and in year 7. I really enjoy coding because its fun, I have been going to Code Club at Orion Health for a year now. I have been to coding events like OMGTech. My favourite subjects at school are Drama and Science. My favourite animal is bunnies and my favourite foods are pancakes and carrots, but I hate spinach. I play Piano, Flute and I also sing. I enjoy getting active outside, like tennis, swimming and cross country. I spend my time doing activities such as reading, rock climbing, baking and coding. I speak lots of languages including English, Flemish, moderate Chinese, Sanskrit and Italian. My mum is from Belgium and my dad is from New Zealand. I have no pets, but really want all pets, most importantly a bunny. I also have twin sisters that are 14 years old. My favourite colour is turquoise and sunset orange. I go to Ficino which is a school in Mount Eden. When I grow up I might become a lawyer or a teacher because I enjoy doing the things involved with these subjects. After the brightsparks comtetion we will probably start our next project. Michelle Dickinson AKA nanogirl is one of my rolemodels. Before we started the project I had done scratch, HTML and will soon be doing python.</p></div>
