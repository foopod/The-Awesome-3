    <p style="padding:1em;">Hi, my name is Amelia Lockley. I am eleven years old.
        I am interested in math, science, robotics and music. I play the piano, cello and I sing. I also do coding. I love coding, and go to a code club at Orion Health, where I have now been going for just over a year now. I have learnt to code using scratch, html & css and python. After I finish working on the website I will go onto to my next project for next year's BrightSparks competition and construct 2. When I grow up I want to be a mechatronic engineer and work somewhere like JPL at NASA like one of my idols Michelle Easter, and my role model is Michelle Dickinson AKA Nanogirl. I have been to lots of coding/tech events like OMGTECH twice, and also I went to the BrightSparks finals with Ruth, who runs the Code Club I go to. I go to Diocesan school for girls. I have been going to Diocesan School For Girls since year one and now I am year seven. My favourite subjects at school are science and math. I learn Japanese and Chinese as languages at school. My Mum is from Indonesia, and my dad is from England. I am an only child. My favourite food is chicken and pesto rice, and my least favourite food is spinach. My favourite colour is turqiuose and my favourite animal is a dolphin. </p>

My favourite animal is a bunny and my favourite foods are pancakes and carrots, but I hate spinach. I play Piano, Flute and I also sing. I enjoy getting active outside, I like tennis, swimming and cross country. I spend my time doing activities such as reading, rock climbing, baking and coding. I speak multiple languages including fluently English, Flemish and moderate Chinese, Sanskrit and Italian. My mum is from Belgium and my dad is from New Zealand. I have no pets, but would really like all of the pets, most importantly a Bunny. I also have twin sisters that are 14 years old. Most importantly my favourite colour is turquoise and sunset orange.I go to Ficino school which is a school in mount Eden.When I grow up I might become a lawyer or a teacher because I enjoy doing the things involved with these subjects.After the brightsparks comitition we will probably start our next project. Michelle Dickinson AKA nanogirl is one of my big rolemodels. Before we started the project I had done scratch, HTML and will soon be doing python.</p></div>
